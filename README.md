## üöÄ Overview

**EcoFusion GND** is an interactive dashboard and data-analysis toolkit that helps Grenada‚Äôs planners balance dollars and clean-energy capacity. From budgeting grid upgrades and storage to optimizing solar, wind, and wave installations, EcoFusion GND turns inputs into recommended unit allocations and gap analyses.

## üîë Key Features

- **Budget Configuration**  
  Reserve portions of your total budget for grid upgrades and energy storage.

- **Estimator Tab**  
  ‚Ä¢ Input your Total Budget ($), Installation Cost Allocation (%), Storage (% of Daily Energy), and Storage Cost ($/kWh)  
  ‚Ä¢ Specify unit costs, outputs, OPEX, and maintenance for Solar, Wind, and Wave technologies  
  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúCalculate Allocation‚Äù computes how many units of each tech you can afford based on cost-effectiveness.

- **Targets**  
  Set renewable-generation and EV-adoption goals over a multi-year horizon.

- **Renewable Progress Tracker**  
  Visualize historical vs. forecasted renewable capacity and budget spending.

- **Implementation Plan**  
  Geo-map proposed installations, view charger or plant locations over Grenada‚Äôs outline.

- **AI Plant Locator**  
  Recommend optimal sites for new renewables using machine-learning suitability scores.
